    support_id(n_nodes; cell_types, cell_offsets, cell_connectivity,
               axis_coordinates) -> String

The SHA-256 digest of section 24, in lower-case hexadecimal: the node
count as one little-endian int64, then the cell types as uint8, the
offsets and the connectivity as little-endian int64, and, for an
`axis` support only, the coordinates as little-endian float64, all in
storage order with nothing between them.

Coordinates of a mesh support are not hashed, because they may vary
between rows while the support does not.

bytes as they are even when those coordinates wrongly vary, so that
such a file breaks E35 and nothing else.
