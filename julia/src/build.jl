`dims` names the axes of `values` in the order your array has them,
and everything else follows from it: `varies` is "row" for a leading
`:row` axis, the group for a leading `Symbol("group:<key>")` axis, and
"none" otherwise, and `components` is the length of the component
axis, which is added for you with length one when your array has none,
because the component dimension is always present (section 19).
Passing a `varies` that says something else is refused as E04.

Left out, `dims` is read off the shape: (:node,) for a vector,
(:row, :node) or (:node, :component) for a matrix, whichever agrees
with the support, and (:row, :node, :component) for a three-axis
array.  A square matrix on a support of as many nodes as it has
columns says nothing about which of the two is meant, so it is
refused rather than guessed at.
