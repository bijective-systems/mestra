# The validator of section 14.
#
# Every rule has an identifier and the identifiers are stable, so this
# file is organised by identifier and says which rule each check is.
# Retired identifiers (E07, W09) are never emitted.  The validator
# works on the file itself rather than on the reader's model, so that
# a file the reader would refuse still gets a full report.
#
# Two rules beyond section 14 as it stands, for what a file that was
# not written by a conforming writer can be:
#
#   E40  a link that is not a hard link anywhere in the public tree.
#        It is reported and never followed: a soft link may point at
#        nothing or in a circle, and an external link would open
#        another file on this file's say-so.
#   E41  an object the validator could not read, with its path. The
#        pass then continues, so that one unreadable object does not
#        hide everything after it.
#
# Every per-object check below runs inside `guard!`, which turns
# anything thrown into E41 against that object's path and carries on.
