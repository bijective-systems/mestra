What a callable returns for one output (section 10).  `mean` is the
point prediction, held the way this package holds every array: the
Julia axes reversed from the file's, so a scalar slot's mean is a
vector over rows and an array slot's is (component, node, row).
`uncertainty` is optional: a band (section 9), the half-width of the
interval around the mean at coverage `level`, of the same shape, made
as `method` says.  The three go together, and a band missing its level
or its method is refused here rather than in a file.
