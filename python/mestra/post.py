"""Post-processing written against the format and nothing else.

Five operations that need no knowledge of where a file came from:
one slot as a prediction, its mean with its band, whether the slot
holds data or a callable serves it;
statistics of a field or a scalar, grouped by a label or a key;
integration of a field over a support or one region of it, with the
weights section 3 says are computed from the connectivity;
a time series at one node along a trajectory; and a split that
honours the unit of generalisation.

They work the same on solver output and on the result of evaluating
a callable, because both are the same file.

A name that is not in the file is the caller's mistake and is raised
without a rule identifier; the identifiers stay for findings about a
file.
