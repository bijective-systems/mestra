"""The validator of SPEC.md section 14.

`validate(path)` opens a file and reports every rule it breaks, by
identifier. `validate(dataset)` checks what an in-memory dataset can
be checked for, which is everything except the byte-level rules of
sections 18 to 25.

Identifiers are stable: within a major version a rule is never
renumbered and a retired rule's identifier is never reused. E07 and
W09 were retired on 2026-09-20 and this validator never emits them.

        /private is left alone, because section 12 lets a producer
        keep its own records there in whatever representation it
        chooses and section 29 forbids a reader to interpret them.
        A group this version does not know is left alone too:
        section 14 says it "is reported as W11 and otherwise left
        alone", and section 28 says where one may be, "at the root
        and inside a support". `_unknown_group` below is those two
        places; the W11 itself is made by the root check and by the
        support check.

        A *dataset* this version does not know, inside a group it
        does know, is checked like any other, and that is finding 12
        of the Phase 3 report, on which the four implementations
        split two against two. The text settles it in two steps.
        Section 14 exempts two things from the byte-level rules of
        sections 18 to 25 and names them: "`/private` is not
        checked, and neither is any group this version of the format
        does not know". A dataset in a support group is neither, so
        it is one of the "public objects only" the rules are checked
        on, and an unchunked one with a row dimension is E27.
        Section 28 is the second step: what a version may add is
        "new optional attributes" and "new optional groups ... at
        the root and inside a support", and not datasets, so an
        unknown dataset is not a forward-compatibility extension at
        all and there is nothing to make room for. It draws no W11
        either, because W11 is "an attribute or a group this reader
        does not know" and this is neither.
