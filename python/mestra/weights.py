"""Integration weights, computed from the connectivity.

Section 3 says a weight array is "computed from connectivity, never
imported", and no document said how one gets into a file. This is
how: `compute_weights(support, location)` makes the measure of every
cell from the coordinates and the connectivity, lumps it onto the
nodes when the weights are wanted there, and stores the result as an
array with the role `weight`, the units of the coordinates raised to
the dimension of the cells, and `recomputed` set.

The measure of a cell is the measure of the simplices it decomposes
into, in the node order section 20 fixes: a line is its length, a
triangle and a quadrilateral their area, a tetrahedron, a hexahedron,
a wedge and a pyramid their volume. One table of simplices covers
them all, and a cell type that is not in it is refused by name rather
than approximated. The quadratic types of section 20 are refused for
that reason: the corner simplices of a curved cell are not the cell.

An `axis` support has no cells. Its nodes are the ends of the
segments between them, which lumps to the trapezoid rule, and that is
what it gets.
