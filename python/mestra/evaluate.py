"""Evaluating a file's callables on a keys table.

Section 10: evaluating a file on a keys table yields a file with the
same slots, now holding data. Distillation is that operation on a
grid.

What the result carries under `/callables`. Section 10 says only
that the slots now hold data, and the four implementations read that
sentence three different ways, which is finding 7 of the Phase 3
report: two leave no `/callables` group, one leaves it present and
empty, one leaves the whole callable with its dictionary. All three
conform -- section 13 lets a container group be absent or present
and empty, and no rule forbids a callable nothing references -- so
the sentence alone does not settle it and another one has to.

Section 12 is that sentence: "A distilled lookup table is stored
data and therefore public; the callable that produced it, its
history, and its validation records are not." The evaluated file is
the distilled table. The callable is the thing section 12 says is
not part of it, so this implementation leaves no `/callables` group
at all: the result is a plain data file with the same keys, the same
supports and the same slot attributes, and every slot's `source` is
`data`.

Section 13's rule that "a writer reproducing a file it read keeps
whichever of the two it found" is about a round trip and not about
this: evaluation does not reproduce the file it read, it produces a
different file, and a group that would be empty may be absent.

Nothing here reads `/private` or copies it. An evaluated file is a
new file and not a round trip of the one the callables came from;
`read` and `write` are what preserve a producer's own records.
