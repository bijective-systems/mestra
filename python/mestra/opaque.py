"""Keeping a group this reader must not interpret.

Section 12 gives a file a `private` group for a producer's own
records, and section 28 lets a version add groups an older reader
does not know. Both must be ignored, not failed on, and a reader
that rewrites a file should not silently drop them. This module
copies such a group into memory as it stands and puts it back
unchanged.

Nothing here interprets what it copies, and nothing here trusts it
either: the walk follows no link, goes no deeper than
`limits.MAX_DEPTH`, and copies no dataset larger than
`limits.MAX_READ_ELEMENTS`. What it could not copy is reported as a
finding and named in the dataset's `lossy` list, and `write` refuses
while any remain rather than writing the file short.

Two things about the copy are worth stating, because both are about
not interpreting what is copied.

The values wait. An open reads attributes, dataspaces and link
types, and section 29 says it "must not read any array"; a private
group is somebody's array like any other, and a file whose /private
holds a gigabyte must still open in the time an open costs. So a
lazy open records each dataset's shape, type, storage and
attachments and leaves the bytes in the file until something asks
for them, which in practice is a rewrite. What a read cannot do
without -- the size limit, the depth cap, a link it will not follow
-- is still decided at open, from the dataspace, so `lossy` says at
open what a rewrite would lose. An eager read reads the values with
everything else.

Dimension scales inside a copied group are kept as they are, and so
is each dataset's attachment to them, because dropping them would
change the file in a way section 30's structural equality sees: the
scale would come back as a plain dataset and the axis it named would
have no dimension. A scale is copied with its CLASS and NAME as they
stand, and the attachments are made after every member exists.
Nothing here decides what a scale of this group means; it decides
only that the file gets back what it gave. An axis attached to a
scale outside the copied group is put back by that scale's link
name, looked for where the group hangs and then at the root, which
is where the file-level scales of section 21 are; one that is
neither is left unattached, because this walk cannot name it without
searching the hierarchy, and section 21 forbids that.
