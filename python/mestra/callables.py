"""The callable protocol, its registry, and the `affine` reference.

A callable is four things and nothing more (SPEC.md section 10):
`__call__` takes a keys table and returns one `Prediction` per output
it serves, `to_dict` represents it as a nested dictionary, `from_dict`
is the inverse dispatched on a `type` string, and `__repr__` is an
optional one-line description. Everything else it knows is inside its
own dictionary and is its own business.

A `Prediction` is a mean and, when the model has one, a band: the
half-width `uncertainty` of the interval around the mean at coverage
`level`, made as `method` says. How the band was computed is the
model's business; what it claims is on the record.

Adding a type is a subclass and one registration call:

        type = "lookup"
