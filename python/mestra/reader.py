"""Reading a mestra file.

`read(path)` returns a `Dataset` having read attributes and
dataspaces only: the row count, the keys with their roles and
bounds, the supports with their ids, and every slot with its
attributes. Values are read when they are asked for, and a row range
of one slot is read without touching any other slot, which is what
section 29 requires.

Pass `lazy=False` to read every value at once and close the file.

A file is untrusted input. This reader follows no link, walks no
deeper than `limits.MAX_DEPTH`, materialises no more than
`limits.MAX_READ_ELEMENTS` in one call, and turns what it cannot
read into a finding on `dataset.problems` rather than an exception
from inside the library. What it could not copy is named in
`dataset.lossy`, and writing such a dataset is refused.

#: The rules under which this reader cannot vouch for what it would
#: return, so `read` refuses a file that breaks one of them rather
#: than hand back values it does not trust. Everything else - a role
#: it does not know, missing units, a cardinality - is the file
#: describing itself badly, and the values still mean what they say.
#: It is the set section 2 of docs/api-conventions.md fixes.
#:
#: One set decides every entry point, which is finding 13 of the
#: Phase 3 report: the metadata open, an eager read, `mestra info`
#: and any operation that reads a slot all go through `_refuse`
#: below and all name the same rule for the same file. A file this
#: reader opens is a file it will read, and a file it refuses to
#: read is one it refuses to open; there is no file that opens and
#: then fails on the first slot, and none that is refused at the
#: door and would have read cleanly. `test_entry_points.py` holds
#: that over every case of the corpus and every hostile file.
#:
#: The one difference section 29 allows is the element cap, and it
#: goes the other way: "a lazy read and a row-range read are not
#: subject to that last limit ... so the same file may be readable
#: one way and E41 the other". A slot too large to materialise is
#: E41 from an eager read of it and readable a row range at a time.
