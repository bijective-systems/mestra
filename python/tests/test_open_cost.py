"""Section 29: what opening a file is allowed to cost.

"Opening a file must not read any array. A reader must be able to
report the row count, the keys with their roles and bounds, the
supports with their ids, and every slot with its attributes, having
read attributes and dataspaces only."

Attributes and dataspaces are linear in the number of objects, so an
open is linear in the number of row-dimensioned datasets or it is not
doing what the sentence says. It was not: an open took 3.1 s at 125
key columns, 10.6 s at 250, 41.6 s at 500 and 155.5 s at 1000, which
quadruples for every doubling and is the signature of a scan inside a
scan. The scan inside the scan was
the section 21 scale index, which maps a scale's object address to
its link name: it was rebuilt from a walk of the whole file once per
dataset, because it was looked up through `dataset.file`, which
hands back a fresh wrapper each time and threw the cache away with
it. One index per pass is what section 21 describes and what the
reader and the validator now build.

A file with a few hundred quantities of interest is an ordinary file,
so these two tests are about an ordinary file and not an exotic one.
They are timings, which are never exact. The second is a ratio and so
is indifferent to how busy the machine is; it is the one that says
what section 29 asks, and the one that fails if the scan inside the
scan ever comes back. The first is an absolute bar, and its number is
chosen rather than derived. A thousand columns opens in about 1.2 s
on the machine this was written on when nothing else is running, and
in 2.6 s on the same machine under a load average of thirty; it took
181 s before. The bar is five seconds, which no machine this is
likely to run on will fail and which nothing quadratic can pass. The
ratio is where the sharp statement lives.

What is left at a thousand columns is not one hot spot but about
1 ms of h5py per object, spent twice: once by the check `read` makes
before it will vouch for a file, and once by the read itself.

The third reconciliation added a file four times wider still.
`cases/wide_keys` is 4200 row-dimensioned datasets on one `row`
scale, which is past the 4085 attachments a dimension scale could
carry before section 21 fixed how one is created, so it is the
first file of its size anybody could write. The two tests at the
end are the same pair of statements about it: an absolute bar that
nothing quadratic passes, and the ratio against the thousand-column
file, which is the one that does not care how busy the machine is.
