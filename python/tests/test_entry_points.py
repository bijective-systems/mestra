"""One rule set decides every entry point.

Where a metadata open and a read do not name the same rule, a caller
moving between two languages finds the same invalid file opening in
one and refused in the other. Within this implementation they name
the same rule, and these tests are what holds it: over every case of
the corpus and every file of the hostile subset, the structural rule
the metadata open names is the one a read names.

The set is `mestra.reader.REFUSED`, which is the one section 2 of
`docs/api-conventions.md` fixes: E01, E16, E19, E25, E26, E29, E30,
E40 and E41. A semantic fault -- a missing unit, a support a row
references and the file does not hold, a dtype the role does not
allow -- never stops a read, so that `info` works on the files a user
most needs to inspect. That is a choice and not an accident, and it
is the same choice at every door.

Section 7 of the conventions is what makes it hold: an open reads
"attributes, dataspaces, link types, and dimension-scale structure,
and ... a category table in full", and "never a slot's data and never
a dataset inside a callable's dictionary". The nine rules are decided
from exactly that. A finding that needs a value the open did not read
-- E32 on a dictionary that holds something section 25 cannot
represent, for one -- waits for the read, along with the value, and
is not one of the nine.

Section 30 asks for more than agreement on the hostile subset:
"Opening the file for its metadata alone, and any operation that
reads a slot, must refuse with the same ids rather than return
something." The last test here is that, against each hostile case's
own `required_errors`.
