"""What this version does not know, and which rule covers it.

Finding 12 of the Phase 3 report, on which the four implementations
split two against two: an ordinary contiguous dataset named `row`
inside a support group, attached to the file's `row` scale. Two
report E27, one of those also W11, and two report nothing. The report
says "the text should say whether an unknown dataset inside a known
group is checked". It already does, in two steps.

Section 14 exempts two things by name from the byte-level rules of
sections 18 to 25: "`/private` is not checked, and neither is any
group this version of the format does not know, which is reported as
W11 and otherwise left alone". A dataset inside a support group is
neither of those, so it is one of the "public objects only" the rules
are checked on: it carries a row dimension, it is not chunked, and
that is E27.

Section 28 is the second step, and it is why there is nothing to make
room for: what a version may add is "new optional attributes" and
"new optional groups ... at the root and inside a support". Datasets
are not on that list, so an unknown dataset is not a
forward-compatibility extension point and is not something a later
version could have meant. It draws no W11 either, because W11 is "an
attribute or a group this reader does not know" and a dataset is
neither.

The three cases are pinned together here, because the argument is
about which of them a thing is and not about any one of them alone.
