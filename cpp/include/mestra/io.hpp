// Reading and writing `.mes` files, and the lazy access SPEC.md
// section 29 requires of a reader.
//
// A file is untrusted input.  A reader of an open format opens files
// it did not write, and a file is a program's input and not its
// instructions, so this one is written to answer a crafted file rather
// than crash on it, and every limit is a stated number and not
// whatever the stack happened to allow.  What it refuses, and says so:
//
//   - an attribute whose dataspace declares more elements than the
//     encoding of section 18 implies.  Every buffer is sized from the
//     count the file declares, never from the encoding, and a count
//     past a stated maximum is left unread and reported;
//   - a dictionary, a group tree or a dump nested deeper than
//     `kMaxDictDepth` (64).  A stack overflow cannot be caught, so the
//     limit is enforced before the descent, and a dictionary accounts
//     its own nesting as values go in (value.hpp), which makes a
//     deeper one impossible to hold rather than merely unsafe to walk;
//   - an element count or a byte length whose product overflows, or
//     passes the stated maximum of 2^31 elements for an eager read.  A
//     dataset that declares a trillion elements and stores none is
//     refused before anything is allocated.  `read_slot_rows` and the
//     other lazy paths are not subject to that maximum, because they
//     never materialise the whole dataset, so the same file can be
//     readable one way and E41 the other (section 29);
//   - a link in the public tree that is not a hard link: a soft link,
//     whether it resolves, dangles or loops, and an external link,
//     which is never opened, because following one would let a file
//     name another file on the machine and have this reader open it.
//     The link's own type is read before anything is opened, so
//     nothing under a link of either kind is ever asked about.  That
//     is E40;
//   - a member of a container group that is neither the kind that
//     belongs there, a nesting past the cap, a malformed object, or an
//     eager read above the maximum element count.  Each is E41,
//     reported with its path while the pass goes on, so that one
//     broken object does not hide the rest of the file.
//
// `/private` is copied whole and so is held whole: one nested deeper
// than 64, holding more than 65,536 objects or more than one gibibyte
// is E41 rather than a silent truncation or an allocation without
// bound.
