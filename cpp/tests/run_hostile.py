"""Run the hostile corpus: every file under tests/hostile/ through
`validate`, `info` and `read`.

These files are not conformance cases and this script checks nothing
about what they mean.  It checks the one thing a reader of an open
format owes anybody who hands it a file: that the answer is an answer.
For each file and each command:

  - the tool exits, within a timeout: never a hang;
  - it exits with a status and not a signal: never a crash;
  - `validate` comes back with at least one finding, on a line in the
    form "<id> <path>: <message>" or "! <path>: <why>";
  - `info` and `read` either succeed or fail with a message, and say
    which file and why.

    python3 run_hostile.py --cli ../build/mestra-cli [--dir hostile]

tests/hostile/make_hostile.py writes the files and says how each one
was made.
